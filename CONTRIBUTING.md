These documents adhear to a basic style guide:

- Each large file must have a index. The headings are auto generated as `-` delimited lowercase strings.
- Headings are generated anchors by GitLab, just copy the existing structure of documents.
- Anti-Patterns:
  - BAD code blocks should be unhighlighted
  - GOOD code blocks should be highlighted
  - Use the `✘ BAD` and `✓ GOOD` headings for readability

- Separate sections with `---`
