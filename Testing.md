## TDD

Test driven development 


#### `1.1` Integration Tests

There are several ways to write integration tests.
- ✘Using tools like **Postman**
- ✓ Writing tests within source code, like regular tests

In order to practice TDD, integration tests must exist within source code. This will
also lend reduced complexity due to lacking the limitations of tools like Postman.
